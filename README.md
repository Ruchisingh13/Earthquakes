# Earthquakes

Get Data: Find earthquake information from trusted sources like USGS or EMSC. Look for details like when and where earthquakes happened, how strong they were, and how deep they were.

Clean Data: Put this data into Power BI. Make sure it's tidy by fixing any mistakes or missing bits.

Make Pictures: Use Power BI to turn the data into pictures. You can show earthquakes on a map, how often they happen over time, and how big they are.

Learn Stuff: Look at the pictures and see what you can learn. Maybe you'll notice some places have more earthquakes than others, or they happen more at certain times.

Tell a Story: Write a short story about what you found. Explain why earthquakes happen and what they can do.

Share: Share your report with others so they can learn too.
